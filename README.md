### The Rat Circus

This is an account I use to keep my personal hobby work separate from my professional work. Part of the point of this is to maintain anonymity, and the contact information I associate with this account is something I'm not intending to make public. If you'd still like to make a business inquiry, I can provide some proper details for getting in touch with me via Discord (the only channel I use for communicating under this handle). Send me a private message at 'Rat Circus#2998' and we'll work something out.

If you'd rather know what I do under this alias, then it's mostly game development. My free hours these days go to modification of Supreme Commander Forged Alliance, an RTS. I'm primarily one of the lead developers of the LOUD Project (https://github.com/LOUD-Project/Git-LOUD).
